# osu-whistle-on-notes
(probably osu!stable only)

a little application i made for myself a long ago to quickly set whistle hitsound on every note (i just like how it sounds)
so basically you need python, then just open this file and select a difficulty
beforehand you need to remove all hitsounds from your diff
then copy other hitsounds from your separate hs difficulty (with kicks snares etc)

or uncomment
select_directory() and comment out select_file() (with #) to select a whole folder

not sure about bugs and edge cases but its working for me
and not sure about lazer - tested only on stable release
