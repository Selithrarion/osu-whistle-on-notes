# osu-whistle-on-notes
(probably stable only)

a little application i made for myself a long ago to quickly set whistle hitsound on every note (i just like how it sounds)
so basically you need python, then just open this file and select a difficulty
beforehand you need to remove all hitsounds from your diff

or uncomment
select_directory() and comment select_file() (with #) to select a whole folder

not sure about bugs and edgecases but its working for me
not sure about lazer - tested only on stable release
